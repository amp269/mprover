Equational Reasoning for a Lazy Functional Language

This is a temporary placeholder for the forthcoming mprover repository. MProver is a proof checker for equational reasoning in a lazy functional language (basically Haskell, but I hesitate to say that in the headline because not all features of Haskell are implemented yet). Feel free to shoot me an email if you're interested in learning more (I can pass along a draft paper submitted to TFP 2012).
